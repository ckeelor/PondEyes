# radar.reader_base
# =================
#
# The input-source abstraction that makes the whole app testable.
#
# Every way of getting LD2450 frames into PondEyes — a real USB/serial bridge, a real MQTT
# broker, or an in-process FAKE source for tests/demos — implements the same tiny `Reader`
# contract: construct with a callback, start(), stop(). The GUI never names a concrete reader
# class; it asks the make_reader() factory for one based on a Sensor's input_mode. That single
# indirection is what lets an automated test (or a hardware-free "sim" run) substitute a
# FakeReader for real hardware with zero changes to the rest of the app.
#
# The callback contract (unchanged from the historical readers): a reader delivers a list of
# per-target tuples (slot, x_mm, y_mm, raw_hex) to `on_frame`. The GUI attributes them to a
# sensor by wrapping the callback in a closure (lambda lst, t, sid=...: self._on_frame(sid, lst, t)).
