# radar.mqtt_client
# =================
#
# Receives LD2450 frames over MQTT (each message payload is one 30-byte frame as a hex
# string), parses them with the shared codec, and delivers them to a callback.
#
# Like serial_reader, this is now a thin transport over radar.frames + radar.reader_base:
# all wire-format knowledge lives in frames, and the start/stop lifecycle comes from Reader.
# The MQTT-specific job is: connect, subscribe, and hand decoded frames off a worker thread
# (so the paho network thread is never blocked by the GUI callback).
#
# Back-compat note: the GUI historically called `reader.connect()` and `reader.cli.loop_stop()`
# directly. We keep `connect()` as an alias of start() and keep the `.cli` attribute so the
# existing GUI keeps working until it is switched to the uniform start()/stop() in Phase 1.
