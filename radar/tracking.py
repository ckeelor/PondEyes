# radar.tracking
# ==============
#
# Book-keeping for live & recent radar targets. Persistence is delegated to a TrackStore
# (SQLite); this class only owns the in-memory state and the per-frame kinematics.
#
# Multi-sensor change: a "slot" (the LD2450's target index 1..3) is only unique WITHIN one
# sensor. Two sensors each reporting a target in slot 1 are two different people, so the live
# slot->serial map is keyed by (sensor_id, slot). Serials ("T1", "T2", ...) stay a single
# global, monotonically-increasing counter so logs remain easy to read across sensors.
#
# update() is called once per incoming frame, on the reader's thread. The GUI wraps the call
# in a lock (see RadarGUI), so this class itself does not lock — it assumes single-threaded
# access to its dicts, which the GUI guarantees.

# ── Speed-sensitivity / slot-reuse split ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The LD2450 reuses a target "slot" when one person leaves and another enters within our
# END_TIMEOUT. Without a guard, the old track's serial gets dragged onto the new person and the
# marker "teleports" across the map. We detect that by displacement-per-frame: if a target jumps
# faster than a human/runner plausibly could for the frame interval, we SPLIT the track (close
# the old one, start a new serial). The threshold is set per-sensor by a "speed sensitivity"
# 0..1, mapped here to a max plausible speed (mm/s). Logs showed organic steps < ~600 mm/frame
# vs teleports > 1500 mm/frame, so there is a wide, safe separation.
